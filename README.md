# Pymaceuticals-Challenge

This repository was created for the "Pymaceuticals - Data Visualization Challenge," where we were tasked with analyzing Pymaceuticals, Inc's squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor treatment on mice. 

All code is stored in the "pymaceuticals_starter" starter file, with the analysis included at the top.
